Bicycle tags :  https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Bicycle

Key	- Value -	Purpose

cycleway - lane/oposit_lane - cycle infrastructure on the road

maxspeed - speed limit - Roads with lower speed limits tend to be less crowded by cars.
source:maxspeed - country_code:rural/country_code:urban/sign/… - Always tag the source of the maxspeed limit!
surface=* -  - asphalt, sand, grass ...
tracktype=* 
smoothness=*
traffic_calming=*	- -	Traffic calming features is a good way to limit the speed of motor vehicles and making the street safer for cyclists.
lanes=*	- total number of marked lanes making up the way - Single lane wide roads with low speed limits tend to be low-stress routes (but may increase stress for cyclists that want to cycle fast)
width -	width of road in metres -	Indicate a wide single lane road or a squeeze point
shoulder - no/yes/left/right/both - Indicate the presence of a shoulder
shoulder:width - width of shoulder in metres - Shoulder width
cycleway - asl - Advanced stop line, also known as bike boxes in North America
maxweight=* -  - Roads without heavy vehicles are more desirable to cyclists.
hgv=* - - Roads without heavy vehicles are more desirable to cyclists.
motor_vehicle=*	- no/destination/delivery/agricultural/etc. - Roads which restrict motor traffic (for example to reach a destination/residents: motor_vehicle=destination) are more desireable to cyclists.


bicycle -	yes -	Where bicycles are permitted, overriding default access (such as to motorways that permit bicycles as commonly found in western parts of North America)
bicycle -designated -	Where a way has been specially designated (typically by a government) for bicycle use
bicycle	- use_sidepath -	Where cycling on the main road is legally discouraged because of a parallel compulsory cycle track. Check with local laws.
bicycle -	optional_sidepath -	Where cycling on the main road is legally allowed but a parallel (optional) cycle track exists.
bicycle -	no	- Where bicycles are not permitted, ensure this is indicated. Note that carrying or pushing bicycles may be still accepted[1][2].
bicycle -	permissive -	Where bicycles do not have a legal right-of-way, but the land owner has indicated that bicycles are allowed.
bicycle -	destination -	Where bicycles have a legal right-of-way, but only if their destination is within that street or area.
bicycle -	dismount -	Where cycling is not allowed on short sections of signposted cycle routes.


amenity	- bicycle_parking
amenity	- bicycle_rental
service:bicycle:rental -	yes
shop -	bicycle
service:bicycle:retail	- yes

amenity	compressed_air - air pumps
compressed_air	yes - air pumps
service:bicycle:pump	yes - air pumps

amenity	- bicycle_repair_station - self repair station
service:bicycle:diy -	yes - self repair station

NATIONNAL/LOCAL/REGIONNAL ROUTE
Tag	Element	Description
icn=yes	way	Designates that a road or path is part of an International Cycling Network route.
ncn=yes	way	Designates that a road or path is part of a National Cycling Network route.
ncn=proposed	way	Designates that a road or path is part of a proposed National Cycling Network route.
rcn=yes / proposed	way	As above, but for regional cycle routes.
lcn=yes / proposed	way	As above, but for local cycle routes.
icn_ref=number	way	A international cycle route, where number is the route number. icn=yes is implied
ncn_ref=number	way	A national cycle route, where number is the route number. ncn=yes is implied
rcn_ref=number	way	A regional cycle route, where number is the route number. rcn=yes is implied
lcn_ref=number	way	A local cycle route, where number is the route number. lcn=yes is implied


FOR COUNTING DATA
amenity -	clock
display	- digital
man_made - monitoring_station - station to count smth
monitoring:bicycle - yes - station counting bicycle and pedestrian at a point
name -	name of counted street
start_date -	year since starting counting
support -	pole
visibility -	street
website -	URL of online data state

EXEMPLE OF CYCLING ROAD RELATION
tag - comment
type=route
route=bicycle/mtb -	See mountainbike for details on tagging mountainbike routes.
network=icn/ncn/rcn/lcn -	Specify the network as an international route, a national route, a regional route, or a local route, as per the normal tagging of cycle routes. For tagging mountainbike routes more specific look here mountainbike
cycle_network=*	- (optional) In countries that have (for instance) multiple regional route networks, this tag indicates the specific route system, much the way network=* does on road route relations.
ref=number	- (optional) Numerical part of reference code of the route. (This formal limit was introduced originally to cater for a certain renderer, so using the full code should be fine too, as long as it can be read from signs along the route.) The network or cycle_network tag already distinguishes the type, so just use "ref" and not "ncn_ref" or similar.
name=*	- (optional) The name of the route e.g. Jubilee Cycle Way
state=proposed	- (optional) Routes are sometimes not official routes pending some negotiation or development -- the opencyclemap rendering shows these routes dotted.
distance=distance - in km	(optional) The distance covered by a route in km
ascent=ascent - in m	(optional) The ascent covered by a route in meters. If a route has start and end point at different altitude use descent too
descent=descent - in m	(optional) The descent covered by a route in meters. Use it only if it differs from the ascent (different altitude at start/endpoint of a route).
roundtrip=yes/no	- (optional) Use roundtrip=no to indicate that a route goes from A to B. Use roundtrip=yes to indicate that the start and finish of the route are at the same location (circular route).
colour=*	- (optional) To indicate the official colour associated with a route. In the Waymarked Trails cycling map, the displayed ref/name of a route gets underlined in this colour (example).
